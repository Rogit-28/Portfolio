# Portfolio

My portfolio site. Yes, I made a whole website instead of just using LinkedIn like a normal person.

Supercharged with Claude.

## What's in here

- Projects pulled live from GitHub - so I never have to update it manually, because I won't
- Pinned repos get the spotlight on page 1. The rest fight for attention on page 2+
- Experience timeline (fancy way of saying "places that let me write code")
- Blog integration via Substack (for when I have opinions)
- Particle backgrounds and animated avatars, because static pages are for resumes

## Tech Stack

Next.js 16 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Framer Motion · GitHub API

## Why

Because a PDF resume can only do so much, and I needed something to show my parents when they ask what I do all day.
