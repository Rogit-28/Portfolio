    "long": "To me, business challenges are a lot like minesweeper. With the right data, uncertainty becomes navigable - every insight reveals the next strategic move. That's what draws me to Business Analytics: the ability to transform raw data into a competitive edge.\n\nMy internships at Kalvium, Acetech Group, and Profisolutions gave me a unique vantage point. I've built the technical frameworks - data pipelines, ML models, automation systems - and I've sat on the other side, using those same tools to shape business strategy. This dual experience helps me speak both languages fluently: translating complex technical work into actionable business outcomes.\n\nI'm actively seeking backend engineering, data science, or AI/ML roles where I can build impactful systems and keep learning."
